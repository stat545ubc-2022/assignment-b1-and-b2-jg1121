#Assignment-B1

This assignment demonstrates my knowledge of creating a function in R, documenting it, and testing it.

I chose to make a function based off a series of code that I followed multiple times in the STAT545A Mini Data Analysis project. This function takes a dataset and then groups a variable and summarizes that variable by the distinct/unique value of another variable. The output is a tibble with two columns, one with the grouped variable, and one with the number of distinct values of the other variable per the grouped variable. 

This function can help answer questions such as, how many different tree species are in each neighborhood in Vancouver?

There are two files in this repository including the .md and .rmd files for my assignment.
